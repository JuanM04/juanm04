My name is Juan MartÃ­n Seery. I'm <!-- AGE:START -->16<!-- AGE:END --> and I'm from Argentina.
Here you'll find some of my open source contributions, like **[PaseTec](https://github.com/JuanM04/pasetec)**, system for my school bus based on cards,
or **[The Cloc](https://juanm04.com/docs/the-cloc)**, a simple alarm that doesn't show you the time.

### Wanna see more 7w7?

You can talk to me with some of the links at the left, or you can se my **[portfolio](https://juanm04.com)**,
or as I like to call it, my _toolbox_ (explanation in spanish [here](https://juanm04.com/docs/pseudo-blog/herramientas-hacker)).
